# MemeSense: A Hateful Meme Detector

MemeSense is a tool that can identify if a meme is hateful or not based on its text and image content.

## Model Architecture

The tool uses a multimodal approach that combines a text embedding model and an image classification model to classify the meme.
The text embedding model encodes the text into a vector representation that captures its semantic meaning.
The CNN model extracts features from the image that are relevant for the classification task.
The fusion model then merges the outputs of the two models and predicts the final label for the meme.
